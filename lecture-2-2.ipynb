    "Python provides a standard library, `random`, for random number generation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). Numpy has a more comprehensive library [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html). For the examples below, we'll use `numpy.random`. \n",

Given a specific seed as input, the output of a random number generator is totally deterministic. However, the numbers that appear are very close to random in a statistical sense. (For much more detail, see the related [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation).)"
