    "### Anatomy of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's diagram what's happening here! `def` is a special word in Python, which tells the computer that we're going to define a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing that comes after `def` is the **name** of the function. Functions are named just like variables are. Here, we just named our function `f`. You can name a function anything that you like, as long as 1) the name doesn't begin with a letter, and 2) it doesn't contain any spaces or special characters other than `_`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the name there are parentheses `()`. The text inside the parentheses are the **arguments** that are passed to the function. When the function is defined, the arguments don't have a particular value, we're just giving them a variable name that will allow us to use them later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This line ends with a colon `:`. Everything below this point that is **indented** forms the **body** of the function. Every time you **call** a function, it sends the arguments that you pass to the functions and then evaluates the code in the **body**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's what happened when you wrote `y = f(1)` above:\n",
    "- Python recognizes that `f` is a function, and it passes the argument `1` to the function `f`  \n",
    "- `f` takes one variable, whose name is `x` -- since we called the function with `f(1)`, `x` is assigned a value of `1`  \n",
    "- The **body** of `f` only contains one line: it first computes `3 * (x**2)`, which gives `3`, and it **returns** this value\n",
    "- Finally, the value of `y` is set to the value that `f(1)` returns, so `y = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "### More function examples and words of caution\n",

    "Try typing in the following examples. Let's consider what happens in each case.\n",
