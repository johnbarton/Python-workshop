You could repeat that analysis, or you could try a more sophisticated method like [Simpson's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule). If you're already comfortable with Python, you might want to try an implementation that uses `numpy` arrays and [vectorization](https://realpython.com/numpy-array-programming/)."
