    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is based on Exercise 8.2 in Mark Newman's [Computational Physics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters.html) textbook. The [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotkaâ€“Volterra_equations) are a simple a model of the population dynamics of predators and prey. They also naturally appear in some physical models and in economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be proportional to the population of prey animals (traditionally called *rabbits*), and  let $y$ be proportional to the population of predators (traditionally called *foxes*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model the rabbits reproduce at a constant rate, but they are also eaten by the foxes. The foxes reproduce at a rate proportional to how much they eat, but they also die of old age. \n",

    "The Lotka-Volterra equations are  \n",

    "What do the parameters in the Lotka-Volterra equations mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the rabbit reproduction rate. We can see this because the rate of change of the rabbit population $\\dot{x}$ has a term $\\alpha x$, which makes the population increase at a rate proportional to itself.\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the rate that rabbits are eaten by wolves. The reduction in the rabbit population due to predation by wolves is proportional to both the number of rabbits $x$ and the number of wolves $y$.\n",
    "- $\\gamma$ is the wolf reproduction rate, which depends on the number of rabbits available as food.\n",
    "- $\\delta$ is the rate that wolves die. The total decrease in the wolf population per unit time depends on the current number of wolves $y$ and the death rate."
